**Railway Reservation System** |  _A CBSE AISSCE Computer Science (083) Project_

# About the Project
Our aim in this project is to develop a Railway Reservation System in Python. It 
is a Simple Railway Reservation System that allows User to â€“ 
- Search Trains 
- Book Tickets 
- Cancel tickets
- Check PNR 
- It also has Admin side which allows extra features like Add Trains and change 
stations. 

# Proof of Concept
A Railway Reservation System allows passengers to book and cancel tickets 
from any of the terminals. These tickets can be purchased or cancelled for 
trips all around the country with travel times of up to 72 hours and distances of 
up to thousands of kilometers. 
Often many a times people live far from railway stations which makes the 
process of booking tickets both Cumbersome and Time Consuming. 
However, our project will enable users to book tickets conveniently from their 
homes with any device with an internet connection in it. 

# Product details
For the project we have used the below mentioned tools - 
- For Backend development we have used MySQL for database. 
- Database is hosted on the internet, and publicly accessible by users 
- And for the frontend or the user interface development we used Python. 
- Our Project will have command line based interface

# Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- an internet connection

To run the program, download ./rrs.py, open a command prompt or terminal window ot the file location, and run the command `python rrs.py`.
